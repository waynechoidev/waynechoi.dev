c:T7d3,
I started diving deep into graphics programming.

I've tried various fields, from web backend to AI deep learning. Initially, working on server applications felt more challenging in terms of system scale, operations, design, and database complexities, rather than focusing on feature implementation. These tasks didn't appeal to me. Deep learning, on the other hand, felt less explicit, and as someone with a limited mathematical understanding of models, it seemed like I was tinkering with hyperparameters to achieve better results without a deeper motivation to study further.

On the other hand, client programming was the most appealing to me because I could develop complex and challenging applications even when the system scale was small. So I could do it on my own. Above all, it was significant to see the results visually as I created them. So I realized that it seems like client programming is the most interesting to me.

All client programming fundamentally relies on 2D graphics, whether it's simply manipulating the DOM or working with CSS within a web browser. Initially, I delved into graphics to implement simple 2D interactions on the web. As the need for more complex computations arose, I ventured into WebGL. Then I even started exploring native graphics APIs like OpenGL to understand intricate pipelines. At some point, I grasped the big picture of the pipeline and the fundamental mathematics and graphics theories, and from that moment on, it became my playground.

At this moment, I'm more interested in offline rendering and fluid and rigid body simulations rather than real-time rendering. As I don't have an engineering degree, I've been feeling a lack in my math and computer science knowledge, so I'm currently studying those areas as well. I'm starting from calculus step by step.

Right now, I don't have a specific plan for how I'll use this learning, but I have no doubt that many opportunities will come my way. Most importantly, I find joy in learning right now.
