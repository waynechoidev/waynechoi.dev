c:T924,
I've started working as a frontend developer at a fintech startup in New Zealand.

I used to have a different job as a boat builder, and I would study web development mainly in the evenings and late at night after putting my child to bed. After about two years of learnigng CS, I successfully made a career change. In the past six months, I've taken a break from web development to study other CS subjects, so I've been focusing on web development for about a year and a half in total.

During this time, I applied to over 300 companies, and it seemed like my resume often didn't even make it past the initial screening, possibly due to my lack of a relevant degree and professional experience. Even when my resume did get through, it was often filtered out by non-tech HR teams, resulting in limited opportunities for technical interviews and tests. Particularly, recent economic downturns made it even more challenging, with a noticeable decrease in hiring for entry-level positions. Still, I managed to attend about twenty interviews, and I received few offers.

The interview questions were incredibly varied. Some places asked about the minutest details, while others focused on fundamental topics like data structures. There was even one place that conducted an in-depth interview on system architecture, which was quite challenging for me as a junior candidate.

The interview process for the company I eventually joined primarily focused on how I would approach product design and decision-making when building their product. I also had discussions about potential improvements to their pre-launch product pages. It felt like I was already a part of their team, and given my experience working on personal projects, I could answer these questions with relative ease. It was an enjoyable experience, and I was able to clearly articulate how I could contribute to the business.

One significant observation during the interviews and hiring processes was that companies seemed more concerned about hiring the right candidate rather than offering higher salaries. The company I joined had a rigorous hiring process that took four months, but when I finally received an offer, it exceeded my expectations. I now have the confidence that this company will reward my performance adequately.

Anyway I'm excited to start a new career now.
