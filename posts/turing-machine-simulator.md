Lately I've been immersing myself in introductory computer science courses. Suddenly, I became captivated by the subject and decided to take a shot at implementing a Turing machine.

I implemented with TypeScript and React. When you select a machine, you can also view the corresponding action table below. To ensure finite tape length, I made certain adjustments, and I ended up creating a total of seven different Turing machines.

Personally, I selected these particular machines because I believe they can provide a better understanding of Turing machines.

- Copy 1s
- Repeat Binary
- Binary Palindlom
- Binary Increment
- Binary Addition
- 3-State Busy Beaver
- 4-State Busy Beaver
