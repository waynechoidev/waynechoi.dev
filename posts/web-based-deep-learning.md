I implemented a web-based linear regression model and a multilayer perceptron model using the well-known Boston housing price dataset. Instead of using machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, I implemented it directly in TypeScript. I also utilized the "chart.js" library for visualizing the results.

As I had been using libraries with abstracted training processes like backpropagation, I decided to implement everything from scratch to gain a better understanding of the underlying operations. Tasks that could be accomplished in a single line with Keras seemed to take much longer here.

You can try out the example below to see the learning process in action.
